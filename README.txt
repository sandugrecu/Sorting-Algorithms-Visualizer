This is a simple python app that uses tkinter to make a visualization of sorting algorithms.

The steps taken to complete the program:
1. Creating the UI for the aplication (I didn't overcomplicate things here).
2. Implementing some sorting algorithms in python.
3. Implementing a function that takes a list (either from the user of hard coded in the program),
and creates a visual representation of the list, i used something like a histogram.

Explaining the steps 
For the UI i did something very simple, for this project I didn't really care a lot for the 
beauty of the application. 

The sorting algorithms used were also some of the most common nothing too special, like bubble sort,
selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.

The visualization of the list was the most important part (even if it's preaty simple).
It calculates the width and height of each element in the list and represents it as a blue 
rectangle. Also it is called after each iteration in the sorting algorithm so we see how the algorithm
works step by step.
