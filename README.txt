This is a simple Python app that uses Tkinter to make a visualization of sorting algorithms.

The steps taken to complete the program:

Creating the UI for the application (I didn't overcomplicate things here).

Implementing some sorting algorithms in Python.

Implementing a function that takes a list (either from the user or hard-coded in the program) and creates a visual representation of the list. I used something like a histogram.

Explaining the steps:
For the UI, I kept it very simple. For this project, I didn't really care much about the beauty of the application.

The sorting algorithms used were also some of the most common ones—nothing too special—like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.

The visualization of the list was the most important part (even if it's pretty simple). It calculates the width and height of each element in the list and represents it as a blue rectangle. 
Also, it is called after each iteration in the sorting algorithm so we can see how the algorithm works step by step.
